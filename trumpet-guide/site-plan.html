       The trumpet dates back thousands of years. The ancestors of the modern trumpet are as varied as they are plentiful,
       but the word "trumpet" in this sense is meant to refer to any sort of conical instrument that produces sound via
       the buzzing of the player's lips. For most of its history, the trumpet has been used in warfare. The blowing of the 
       trumpet was loud enough to be heard over the fray of battle, and so trumpets were used to send signals to soldiers 
       on the battlefield. Trumpets began being used for musical purposes during the Renaissance period, primarily in the 
       courts of nobility, and did not join other instrumental musicians such as string orchestras for quite some time. 
       There were various trumpets used in the Baroque era, but these trumpets did not have the same flexibility and versatility
       as today's valved trumpets, and the Baroque trumpet was therefore extremely limited in what it could and could not play.
       The invention of the keyed trumpet in the late 1780s changed the course of trumpet history forever, cementing the 
       instrument as a valid instrument for soloistic and ensemble purposes.

      <h3>Intro to Brass Playing</h3>
       <p>
         All instruments use vibration to get their sound, as that is all sound really is. Stringed instruments such as the guitar 
         or violin use the vibration from the plucking of the string or the drawing of the bow on the string to create the sound 
         that we hear. Pianos have dozens of strings tuned to each individual pitch, and when you press down the key, a hammer strikes 
         the corresponding string, creating the sound we know. Brass instruments use air to create sound. When a trumpeter plays 
         a note on the trumpet, they buzz their lips to create vibrations that are then amplified by the instrument to create 
         the sounds we hear. The earliest and most primitive "trumpets" were ost likely conch shells and animal horns 
         that people blew into to create loud sounds. As sound is a science, there are certain laws of physics that instruments 
         have to follow. Brass instruments have what is called a "harmonic/overtone series", which is a series of pitches that 
         a brass instrument can naturally play. These notes are also referred to as "partials". As we can see in the diagram, 
         as the partials get higher, they also get closer together. This meant that in order to play with the same flexibility 
         as a harpsichord or a violin, trumpeters would have to play extremely high. However, as any brass player knows, this 
         is extremely taxing on the muscles in your lips. Most baroque trumpet music is extremely high and extremely taxing for this reason.
         The key to achieving the chromatic flexibility that string instruments enjoyed was modifying the natural trumpet and 
         allow the player to play more notes. If you made the instrument longer, it would play lower, and if you made the 
        instrument shorter, it would play higher.</p>
       <p>
         Initially, trumpet makers would just make the trumpets in different lengths, so that one trumpet could be pitched in 
         C(meaning that the series started on the C pitch), and another could be pitched in G, and so on and so forth. Trumpeters 
         understandably got tired of lugging around a million different horns, and the Baroque trumpet was created. The Baroque 
         trumpet had a series of holes in the pipe that the player could cover to modify the pitch, similar to how a flute works. 
         This worked somewhat well, but the air that would escape through the uncovered holes messed with the tuning and the tone 
         of the instrument, and the flexbility of stringed instruments was still not achieved. In the 1780s, a man named Anton Weidinger 
         the keyed trumpet, a trumpet with levers and keys on it that kept the holes covered when not in use, but most importantly 
         this keyed trumpey allowed players to utilize the full chromatic scale. With this new instrument, composers like Franz Joseph 
         Haydn were contracted to write concertos for this new trumpet. During the 19th century, the keys were replaced with valves. 
         The valves, when pushed down, redirect the air into a new set of tubing that can alter the pitch of the trumpet. These valves allowed 
         the player to play every note in the chromatic scale, but with more technical ease than the keyed trumpet and without the tuning issues that 
         had plagued the keyed and Baroque trumpets.

      <h3>Bb trumpet</h3>
      <p>
        In the 19th century, the keyed trumpet was gradually phased out and replaced with the valved B-Flat cornet. The B-Flat cornet 
        has a conical bore, and the sound that comes from it is broader than the sound we get from a B-Flat trumpet. Virtuosos in the 1800s 
        such as the French Jean-Baptiste Arban and the American Herbert L. Clarke authored technique books for the cornet that are used 
        by trumpeters to this day. The cornet works exactly like the trumpet, and the only difference is its conical bore bell that creates 
        more of a deeper sound. Today, however, most players play the B-Flat trumpet instead of the cornet.
      </p>
      <P>
        The B-Flat trumpet, emerged in the form we know it today around the same time as the B-Flat cornet. The main difference 
        between this trumpet and the cornet is the trumpet has a cylindrical bore, which shoots the sound out of the trumpet more directly than 
        the conical bore that the cornet has. In imagining this, imagine the cornet being like a wide flashlight, while the trumpet is like a direct, concentrated beam 
        of light. As the name suggests, the B-Flat trumpet is pitched in B-Flat, meaning that the harmonic series begins on the concert B-Flat pitch. 
        In order to simplify things, the trumpet's music is also pitched in B-Flat, so when a trumpet player plays their "C", they are truly playing a B-Flat. 
        The Bb trumpet is in the same key as the clarinet, the tenor and soprano saxophones, and the euphonium.
        The Bb trumpet is the most basic of the modern trumpets, and when amateur players first start learning the trumpet, 
        they learn the Bb trumpet. You'll see Bb trumpets in marching bands, concert bands, and jazz bands. Nine times out of ten, 
        if you're hearing a trumpet in a non-orchestral setting, it's a B-Flat. 
      </P>
      <p>
        Another adjacent instrument to the Bb trumpet is the flugelhorn. Flugels are also pitched in B-Flat, but flugelhorns 
        aren't usually someone's main instrument, but instead they're used for special occasions to get a certain tone 
        quality. The flugelhorn has a very deep, mellow tone and is used mainly to get a prettier sound that you simply can't 
        do on a trumpet. Flugels are usually seen in jazz ensembles, but sometimes you'll find them in a drum and bugle corps 
        or in a concert band, but only as special instruments used for their beautiful tone quality.

      </ul>
      <h3>C trumpet</h3>
      <p>
        The C trumpet is arguably the most versatile of the trumpets. Back in the day, composers would write music for a 
        multitude of differently pitched trumpets as there were a million different kinds of trumpets back then. In Beethoven's 7th 
        Symphony, the trumpet part is written in D and E, meaning that the players would play D and E trumpets and read 
        the music. Many Classical and Romantic trumpet parts are written in a whole ton of keys, and players are expected to 
        "transpose", which means to look at the written note and play the actual note. If your part is in B-flat, you'll look at 
        a C on the page, and play a concert B-flat instead, as you have to transpose from B-Flat to C. This is a skill that is 
        expected of professional classical trumpet players aross the world. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        You might be asking, "why not just bring a B-Flat to play the part in B-Flat or just write the B-Flat music in C?"
      </p>
      <p> 
        The C trumpet is pitched in a way that gives it a bit deeper of a tone, and it's easier for players to sound loud and grand 
        on the C trumpet than it is on the B-Flat trumpet. You absolutely could just play the Bb music on the Bb trumpet, but it's 
        not the social norm, nor is it going to match the minute tuning and tone differences of the orchestra, which the C trumpet is created to match. 
        As for why we don't write the B-Flat music in C, many orchestral pieces will have the player switch keys during the piece. 
        You could very easily start a piece pitched in C, and then the music pitches to Bb, and then to D, and then to A. Sheet music producers simply 
        don't rewrite all of these pitch changes, and leave it up to the player to do the transposition on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll find the C trumpet in symphonic orchestras. If you go to a symphony concert or watch a movie, it's likely that you'll be hearing 
        the C trumpet. The C trumpet, once again as its name suggests, is pitched in C, making it pitched in the same key 
        as pianos, string instruments, trombones, tubas, and the flute.

      </ul>
      <h3>Eb/piccolo trumpet</h3>
      <p>
        Like the flugelhorn, the Eb trumpet is extremely niche. The Eb trumpet is pitched in Eb, but the range of the instrument is 
        much higher than the Bb and C trumpets. This gives the Eb trumpet a unique Classical sound, and the Eb is used when performing 
        much of the trumpet music from that time period. The most common place you'll hear the E-flat trumpet is actually in its 
        solo repertoire. After the invention of the keyed trumpet in the 1780s, Franz Joseph Haydn and Johann Nepomuk Hummel 
        both wrote concertos for this new instrument. Both concertos were pitched in E-flat, and the E-flat trumpet keeps its use and relevance 
        today mainly through the performance of these concertos. Other than this, you'll hear it occasionally in come Classical-era music 
        when the part is just high enough that it would sound easier and prettier on an Eb, instead of a C.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember how before the keyed trumpet, trumpet music had to be extremely high in order to be flexible? People still like 
        to perform that music, but the extremely high parts can sound strained on the Bb or C trumpets, and even the Eb trumpet. 
        The modern solution for this is the piccolo trumpet. The piccolo trumpet is pitched exactly one octave above the Bb trumpet, 
        so the low C on the piccolo trumpet will be the middle C on the Bb trumpet. Piccolo trumpets also feature a changeable slide that 
        can make the instrument be pitched in A, as Baroque music was often pitched in A. The Bb side of the piccolo trumpet is mostly 
        used in more modern compositions that require the instrument. You'll hear the piccolo trumpet in orchestras with pieces like Handel's 
        Messiah, or in small ensembles when they perform Bach's Brandenburg Concertos. The piccolo trumpet, while less niche than the E-flat, 
        is still used less regularly than the B-flat or C.
