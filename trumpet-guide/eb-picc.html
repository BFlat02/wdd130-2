            <h1>The E-Flat and Piccolo Trumpets</h1>
    
            <p>
                Like the flugelhorn, the Eb trumpet is extremely niche. The Eb trumpet is pitched in Eb, but the range of the instrument is 
                much higher than the Bb and C trumpets. This gives the Eb trumpet a unique Classical sound, and the Eb is used when performing 
                much of the trumpet music from that time period. The most common place you'll hear the E-flat trumpet is actually in its 
                solo repertoire. After the invention of the keyed trumpet in the 1780s, Franz Joseph Haydn and Johann Nepomuk Hummel 
                both wrote concertos for this new instrument. Both concertos were pitched in E-flat, and the E-flat trumpet keeps its use and relevance 
                today mainly through the performance of these concertos. Other than this, you'll hear it occasionally in come Classical-era music 
                when the part is just high enough that it would sound easier and prettier on an Eb, instead of a C.

                Remember how before the keyed trumpet, trumpet music had to be extremely high in order to be flexible? People still like 
                to perform that music, but the extremely high parts can sound strained on the Bb or C trumpets, and even the Eb trumpet. 
                The modern solution for this is the piccolo trumpet. The piccolo trumpet is pitched exactly one octave above the Bb trumpet, 
                so the low C on the piccolo trumpet will be the middle C on the Bb trumpet. Piccolo trumpets also feature a changeable slide that 
                can make the instrument be pitched in A, as Baroque music was often pitched in A. The Bb side of the piccolo trumpet is mostly 
                used in more modern compositions that require the instrument. You'll hear the piccolo trumpet in orchestras with pieces like Handel's 
                Messiah, or in small ensembles when they perform Bach's Brandenburg Concertos. The piccolo trumpet, while less niche than the E-flat, 
                is still used less regularly than the B-flat or C.
